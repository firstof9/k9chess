{"name":"K9 Chess","tagline":"Code and configuration files for a chess playing enhancement to a remote presence robot","body":"### What is this project about?\r\nIn late 2015, the Radio Times in the UK published a very nice article about Richard Hopkins' robot dog build (@hopkira).  They not unreasonably pointed out that the tin dog from the BBC TV program was able to beat his master at chess.  The Radio Times wondered if this Raspberry Pi based K9 could do the same thing?  So did we.\r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\nThe primary objectives are to create a chess playing robot dog in the image of Doctor Who's K9 that can play chess at Grand Master level using a Raspberry Pi and as natural an interface as possible.  The capability will be used at an event to inspire kids to play chess and to take up STEM subjects.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPrimary contributors to the project are Carl Spencer (@CarlSpencer-IBM) and Richard Hopkins (@hopkira).  Both are senior architects within IBM's complex systems integration business.  Given that one of our company's greatest moments was creating the Deep Blue chess playing computer that beat Kasparov, we wondered (perhaps somewhat impudently) whether we could do the same with a $35 computer from 2015 powered by a Golf Buggy battery in the shape of a 1970's robot dog.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease visit [Old dog, new tricks](http://k9-build.blogspot.co.uk/) to raise any issues, comments or make contact.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
