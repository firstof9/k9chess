<a id="what-is-this-project-about" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this-project-about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this project about?</h3>

<p>In late 2015, the Radio Times in the UK published a very nice article about Richard Hopkins' robot dog build (<a href="https://github.com/hopkira" class="user-mention">@hopkira</a>).  They not unreasonably pointed out that the tin dog from the BBC TV program was able to beat his master at chess.  The Radio Times wondered if this Raspberry Pi based K9 could do the same thing?  So did we.</p>

<h3>
<a id="objectives" class="anchor" href="#objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objectives</h3>

<p>The primary objectives are to create a chess playing robot dog in the image of Doctor Who's K9 that can play chess at Grand Master level using a Raspberry Pi and as natural an interface as possible.  The capability will be used at an event to inspire kids to play chess and to take up STEM subjects.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>Primary contributors to the project are Carl Spencer (<a href="https://github.com/CarlSpencer-IBM" class="user-mention">@CarlSpencer-IBM</a>) and Richard Hopkins (<a href="https://github.com/hopkira" class="user-mention">@hopkira</a>).  Both are senior architects within IBM's complex systems integration business.  Given that one of our company's greatest moments was creating the Deep Blue chess playing computer that beat Kasparov, we wondered (perhaps somewhat impudently) whether we could do the same with a $35 computer from 2015 powered by a Golf Buggy battery in the shape of a 1970's robot dog.  Carl is one of the top 250 or so chess players in the UK, so hopefully we're in with a chance of success!</p>
